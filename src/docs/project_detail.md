This is the task:
Build a small search GUI that uses this API: http://www.omdbapi.com/
- Searching for a keyword should return a list of movies
- Searches with no results (e.g. "&*#" ) should display feedback to user
- Save the last 3 searches in a local storage or similar and show them somehow to the user (at best as a little dropdown from the search)
- Use React Hooks or Redux
